# Walkthrough

The title of the challenge seems to clue us in on the scope of the challenge: web headers. This means that a good place to start looking is our browser's [*Network Monitor*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Network_Monitor) (I use Firefox, so I have linked to Mozilla's documentation).

By examing HTTP requests in our browser's *Network Monitor*, we can take a look at some *Headers*.
