# Gerardos Bio 2 (100 Points)
## Gerardo recently started using [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gerardo_2001_), but he hasn't filled out his bio yet. He's recently gotten into astrology and wants to include his Mars sign in his bio. Can you help him out?

## The flag is in the format of gigem{sign_degrees_minutes_seconds}

## Example: Aquarius 8Â°00'44" is gigem{aquarius_8_00_44}

# Walkthrough

[A previous challenge](https://github.com/mrubensilva/TAMU-CyberSec/tree/main/National%20Cyber%20League%202022%20Spring%20Season/Prerequisite%20Challenges/OSINT/Gerardos%20Bio%201#the-flag-is-gigem12232001) revealed that Gerardo's birthday was December 23rd, 2001. Unfortunately, if you want to figure out somebody's [Mars sign](https://cafeastrology.com/whats-my-mars-sign.html), you need more than just their birthday.

In fact, we need to comb through Gerardo's Twitter (linked in the challenge prompt) for leads on his time of birth and his birth city. We can find Gerardo's time of birth pretty easily, as [one tweet](https://twitter.com/gerardo_2001_/status/1477823900591529984?s=20&t=DTlIkvduuX6ic-NFX0V_BA) spells it out for us.
