# Walkthrough

The objective of this challenge is to find out Gerardo's birthday. His Twitter page, provided in the challenge prompt, should be a good place to look for clues.

Our first major clue to Gerardo's birthday is in his username(s). People commonly include their birth year in their username, so it's not too far-fetched of an assumption that "2001" might be the year of Gerardo's birthday. As for the month and date, we need to dig a bit deeper, perhaps by combing through Gerardo's tweets.

Sure enough, [one tweet](https://twitter.com/gerardo_2001_/status/1474055931138871306?s=20&t=DTlIkvduuX6ic-NFX0V_BA) reveals that Gerardo celebrates his birthday on December 23rd. Gerardo's birthday is 12/23/2001

### The flag is ```gigem{12/23/2001}```.
