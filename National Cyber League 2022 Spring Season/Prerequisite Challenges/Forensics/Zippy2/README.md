# Walkthrough

The asset the challenge provides is a GZ file, which can be extracted with either 7zip or gzip.

When the extracted file of unknown type fails to open, (my go-to file formats are .txt or .zip) consider reformatting the file.

You may have to repeat the first few steps a couple of times in order to eventually locate the "flag.txt" file.

If a file looks weird or corrupted in a CTF competition, that usually means you have to dig deepter. Try reformatting the file again.
