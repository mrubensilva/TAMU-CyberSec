# Walkthrough

The title of the challenge is "Rails," and its prompt seems to highlight the word "fence" by italicizing the word. This should encourage you to do a web search for something like "Rails fence cryptography." With that, you would likely discover the Rail Fence Cipher. Luckily, [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/), the Cyber Swiss Army Knife, has a couple of tools for Rail Fence Ciphers. As far as figuring out the Key and the Offset, that may require a bit of trial and error.

### The flag is: ```gigem{g00d_luck_3v3ry0n3}```
