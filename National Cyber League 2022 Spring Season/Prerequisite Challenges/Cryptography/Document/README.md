# Document (100 Points)

## I found this on the back of a famous US political document after putting some lemon juice on it. What does it mean, who put it there? What is the flag?

# Walkthrough

The challenge prompt references the greatest movie of all time, [National Treasure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Treasure_(film)), where masterful actor [Nicolas Cage](https://www.homestuck.com/story/darkcage) reveals a message hidden within the [Declaration of Independence](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript).

Keeping that in mind, you can take a look at the ciphertext. You may notice that there is a part of the ciphertext that looks like it contains the flag, e.g, curly braces. Except, the characters are shifted around a whole bunch.

*However*, after looking really closely, you might notice that this ciphertext actually doesn't resemble the Declaration of Independence all that much, and not just because it's encoded a whole bunch. Still, let's not drop this lead altogether. Personally, I think this particular order of characters looks a lot like *another* important historical document from US history: the United States Constitution, specifically, [The Preamble](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/preamble).

With a better lead on the known plaintext, or "crib," we can so a bit of *Magic*.
